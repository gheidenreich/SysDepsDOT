# SysDepsDOT
Build dynamic system dependencies graphic from very simple text language. Requires GraphViz install to work, add to path.

List systems, and for each dependency From > To with labels, auto-creates graphic of your dependencies.

This has gone untouched for several years. 

Just noticed not all files came up... I'll work on that. 

In the meantime, compile as Windows Console proj, and it will build your dot file. Use GraphViz to generate image.
